As far as I can see then Head will never move anywhere since head get sat to dummy which is instantiated with -444 and Null
This will then result in a linked list for tail that grows but never gets removed from. since put() only touches tail.

this will simply fill up the memerory space and therefore end up in a fault/exception.
