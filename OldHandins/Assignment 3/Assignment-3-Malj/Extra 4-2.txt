1) Summation of 1000 to 1..
> let sumt = run (fromString "let sum n = if n = 0 then n else sum (n-1) + n in sum 1000 end");;
val sumt : int = 500500
This wont do negative numbers.

2) Computing 3^8 in a naive way. with recursion.
> let facttt = run (fromString "let fact n = if 1 = n then 3 else fact (n-1) * 3 in fact 8 end");;
val factt : int = 6561

Since the function only takes one argument 3 has to be hardcoded.

3)
> let sumfact = run (fromString "let fact n = if 1 = n then 3 else fact (n-1) * 3 in let sum g = if 0 < g then fact g + sum (g-1) else 1 in sum 11 end end");;
val sumfact : int = 265720

4)
> let sum10fact8 = run (fromString "let sum a = if 0 < a then let pows y = if 0 < y then a * pows(y-1) else 1 in pows 8 end + sum (a-1) else 1 in sum 10 end");;

val sum10fact8 : int = 167731334
